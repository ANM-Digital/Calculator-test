## 🧮 Features

The Calculator Web App is divided into two main modes: **Basic** and **Advanced (Scientific)**. Here's a detailed breakdown of the features:

### 🔹 Basic Calculator (`index.html`)

The Basic Calculator is designed for everyday use, providing a simple yet powerful tool for performing common arithmetic operations. Key features include:

- **Standard Arithmetic Operations**: Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`×`), Division (`÷`).
- **ANS (Answer) Button**: Reuse the result of the last operation for subsequent calculations, saving you time.
- **Percentage Button (`%`)**: Quickly calculate percentages by entering a value and pressing `%`.
- **Clear (C) & Backspace (⌫)**: Easily reset the current calculation or delete the last entered digit.
- **Equals Button (`=`)**: Perform the calculation and output the result.
- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes for improved visibility in various lighting conditions.
- **Responsive Layout**: The design automatically adjusts to fit desktop, tablet, and mobile screens, ensuring a smooth experience on any device.
- **Keyboard Support**: Perform calculations directly from your keyboard with support for key presses.
- **Dynamic Button Layout**: Buttons are dynamically arranged to suit different screen sizes and devices, improving usability.

### 🔸 Advanced Calculator (`/advanced/advanced.html`)

For users who need more advanced functionalities, the **Advanced Calculator** offers a wide range of scientific features. It is ideal for students, professionals, and anyone needing to perform complex calculations. Some of the features include:

- **Scientific Functions**: Functions such as `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `ln` (natural log), `log` (base 10), `π` (pi), `√` (square root), `x!` (factorial), and `x²` (square) are available.
- **Second Function Toggle (`2nd`)**: Access additional functions for each button by pressing the `2nd` button, which provides secondary functionalities for most scientific buttons.
- **Dynamic Button Rendering**: Buttons are rendered dynamically based on a configuration object, making it easy to modify or extend the calculator's functionality.
- **Grid-Based Layout**: The advanced calculator uses a grid-based layout to organize functions logically and clearly, ensuring a neat and clean interface.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: The app's design is fully responsive, and it adjusts seamlessly to smaller screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Customizable**: As an open-source project, the Advanced Calculator can be easily customized or extended to include additional mathematical operations or features.
